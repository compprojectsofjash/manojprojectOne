Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.
Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.
A room without books is like a body without a soul.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.

But man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.
When you reach the end of your rope, tie a knot in it and hang on. 
You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist. 
There is nothing permanent except change.
